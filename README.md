## Objectives
- **Analyze Downtime Factors**: Identify and categorize the main factors contributing to factory downtime.
- **Improve Operator Efficiency**: Measure and improve operator efficiency by addressing downtime causes.

## Key Insights
Based on the data analysis, the following actionable insights were identified:

1. **Start with Machine Adjustment Training for All Operators**  
   Providing machine adjustment training will help all operators better manage minor issues without needing external support, minimizing machine stoppages.

2. **Provide Special Batch Change Training for the Operator 'Mac'**  
   Specific training on batch change procedures will help the operator identified as "Mac" perform these tasks more effectively, reducing the time lost during transitions.

3. **Apply Preventive Maintenance of Machines and Double-Check Inventories**  
   Implementing a schedule for preventive maintenance will help avoid unexpected breakdowns, and ensuring inventory accuracy will reduce delays due to missing or incorrect parts.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data entry, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on downtime events, operator actions, and machine performance.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processed the data for consistency and accuracy.
3. **Analysis**: Analyzed the data to identify patterns in downtime causes and operator efficiency.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations in Excel to highlight key findings and downtime trends.

## Conclusion
This project has provided insights that can be applied to reduce downtime and improve operator efficiency. By implementing the suggested training programs and maintenance routines, the manufacturing unit can expect to see a reduction in downtime and an increase in productivity.
